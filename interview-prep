 REST based API
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is a web
standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol for data communication.

A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for
exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written
in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use
web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet
in a manner similar to inter-process communication on a single computer.
This interoperability (e.g., between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux
applications) is due to the use of open standards.

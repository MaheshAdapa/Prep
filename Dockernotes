Docker Installing

yum install -y yum-utils \
  device-mapper-persistent-data \
  lvm2

  yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

    yum install docker-ce

  systemctl start docker
  systemctl  enable docker
  View docker images (docker images)
  Get docker images from docker hub ( docker pull image Name)
  To run the docker container in background  docker run container -d --name container name  Image name
  docker run -itd --name test1 httpd /bin/bash

  Changing Docker Storage Driver to devicemapper
  Check current Storage Driver by using command (docker info)
  vi /etc/Docker/daemon.json
  Add below
  {
"storage-driver": "devicemapper"
}
 Restart Docker (docker restart)
 check docker info | grep storage Driver

 Changing Docker logging Driver from json to local rsyslog
 We can find the logs of container default by command docker logs and it is in Json format but we would like to send all these logs to host system logs
 for that we need to activate rsyslog in host system
 vi /etc/rsyslog.config
 uncomment below lines in the configuration file
 $ModLoad imudp
 $UDPServerRun 514
 Add below lines to vi /etc/Docker/daemon.json
 {
"storage-driver": "devicemapper",
"log-driver": "syslog",
"log-opts":{
	"syslog-address": "udp://172.28.128.3:514"
	}
}
Restart Docker (docker restart)
docker info | grep Logging
Logging Driver: syslog

Now by default all docker logs will be viewed under /var/logs/messages
But if you want to have custom logs for single container run the below command
docker container run -d --name Container Name --log-driver json-file Image name
Example: docker container run -d --name testjson --log-driver json-file httpd

Setting up Docker Swarm
Creating docker manager
 docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.28.128.3 ( Ip address of host system)
To add new docker worker use below command
docker swarm join-token worker
To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2kfy9x7fyegio78j0uxga4yukx1rcmdpuhip7jjp4tm3p7nlq1-8dm3cj42mpygdz4a11p6k5yo9 172.28.128.3:2377
if you want to create another manager
docker swarm join-token manager
To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2kfy9x7fyegio78j0uxga4yukx1rcmdpuhip7jjp4tm3p7nlq1-8dm3cj42mpygdz4a11p6k5yo9 172.28.128.3:2377

Adding Node to Docker swarm
Take a new linux box and install docker on it
collect worker  token from leader Docker instance and run in new linux box
check nodes by using command docker node ls
example
ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
n8685zrzad8g59k8by6hklz6u     jenkins             Ready               Active
l7hduli1wetixu1s4mz1ozy7c *   kube                Ready               Active              Leader

 How to create Service in Docker swarm
 Every service is created from Docker Leader
 docker service create --name (name of service) --publish(port) 80:80 --replicas 2 images
 Example: docker service create --name bkupweb --publish 80:80 --replicas 2 httpd
Check you service  docker service ls
Example
[root@kube ~]# docker service ls
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
12r8jg2xiypv        bkupweb             replicated          2/2                 httpd:latest        *:80->80/tcp
Check you service on which node it is working
Example
docker service ps bkupweb
ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE                    ERROR               PORTS
pqhoe0i81vur        bkupweb.1           httpd:latest        kube                Running             Running 4 minutes ago
51ugw77b1nue        bkupweb.2           httpd:latest        node2               Running             Running less than a second ago
Note: Check in other nodes by docker ps to confirm

Create Docker  swarm backup and restore
Stop docker in manager (systemctl stop docker)
Take copy of /var/lib/docker/swarm
tar -zcvf swarm.tar.gz
Copy the swarm.tar.gz file to different Docker manager and un tar to location /var/lib/docker
To re-initialize your backup use the below command
docker swarm init --force-new-cluster
Then you will get token
check you docker cluster is working by (docker service ls)
docker service ps
The cool thing what about this is As long as a health cluster you take backup of swarm directory is fine to create whole cluster
we don't even needed docker images also all we need swarm directory

Outline the Sizing Requirements Prior to Installation
Cluster Sizing Requirements
It depends in general,Sizing your environment for a Docker Swarm cluster is going to
be the same process that you would use for any application in your ecosystem.
you would need to consider things like:
1.CPU,Memory and Disk
    Your containerized application will have the same Requirements that it would if Running
    on other infrastructure (physical or virtual). Be sure your underlying hosts(s)
    have the necessary horsepower.
2.Concurrency
   What are the load requirements of the application at peak and in total?
  These will determine optimal placement and the amount of hardware resources(Constraints)
  you need to allocate.

  Universal Control Plane(UPC)
  Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) is the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker.
  You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud,
  and it helps you manage your Docker swarm and applications through a single interface.
  For Universal Control Plane(UPC) system requirements follow below link
  https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.1/guides/admin/install/system-requirements/#network-requirements


  Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)
  Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) is the enterprise-grade image storage solution from Docker.
  You install it behind your firewall so that you can securely store and manage the Docker images you use in your applications

  Minimum Requirements
  8gb RAM (MANAGER or DTR Nodes)
   4gb RAM (Workers)
   3gb Free Disk

   Recommended Requirements
   16gb RAM (MANAGER or DTR Nodes)
   4vCPU (Workers or DTR Nodes)
   25-100gb Disk Space

   3. Performance Considerations (Timing)
      We need take network Performance

        Recommendations
        . Plan for Load Balancing
        . Use External Certificate Authority for Production

Set Up and configuration Universal Control Plan(UCP) and Docker Trusted Repository(DTR) for Secure Cluster
management

Setting up Universal Control Plan(UCP)
Make sure atlest 2 GB of ram befor running blow command to set up UCP
docker container run --rm -it --name ucp -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker/ucp:2.2.4 install
--host-address 172.28.128.3 --interactive

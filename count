Hi venkata mahesh babu,

Thank you for your application to the DevOps Engineer role that we'd like to fill at Monetate. I am interested in your background and experience and would like to initiate the interview process.

The first step of our process includes completion of a coding assessment. The assessment is expected to take approximately 20 minutes and should be completed within the next 7 days. The link below will direct you to the assessment. Once it is completed I will follow up with next steps. Thank you!
